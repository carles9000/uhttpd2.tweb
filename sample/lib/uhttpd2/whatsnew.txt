Vrs. 0.93d
==========
Add oDom methods:
- SetDlg( cIdDlg ) 
When we define a form it has an id. If we define a dialog it also has its id. Each form has its scope or scope of variables.
All the parameters of the form form this scope by default. If we want to act with a method of another form loaded on the 
screen, we must specify that id. With :SetDlg(cIdDlg) we can change the scope. See examples dialogs pagos

- DialogClose( cIdDlg ) We can close an open dialogue. See examples dialogs pagos


Vrs. 0.92
=========
Add new server properties: 

- lDbfAutoClose := .t./.f.  // by default .t. 
When we establish a connection we use "keep alive" this allows us to have if we want a dbf table open. 
By default, whenever we leave the thread, the server closes all open areas. Putting the alias in a 
static thread variable and setting the data lDbfAutoClose := .f. , every time we enter the thread if 
we are still in the same connection, we can recover the alias and we won't have to reopen the table.

- nSession_Timeout , value in seconds. 30sec by default.

It is the time that our "keep alive" connection will be open
